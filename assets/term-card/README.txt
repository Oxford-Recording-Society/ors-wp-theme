The files in this directory generate a term card for the oxford recording society website.

The program utilises functionality from The Events Calendar by Knowledgebase to make adding events to the calendar user friendly 
by using the plugin's existing events publishing form. Note this program was designed to work with version 5.9.0 of the plugin
so there is no guarantee that it may work with future versions.

How to set up the calendar:

1. Add the event categories.

On the WP dashboard navigate to Events -> Event Categories.

Ensure that the following event categories are added and that they are written exactly as stated here:

Topic: Music Events Management
Topic: Music Business
Topic: Music Art & Media
Topic: Music Making & Performing
Type: Information
Type: Socials
Type: Gigs & Performances
Type: Club Nights
Type: Workshops
Type: Panels
Type: Speakers

2. Before adding society events:

Before adding events the term card must be given the term start date by creating a new event titled "Term Start" with the start date
being when the term starts.

To create a new event navigate to Events -> Add New

3. Add Society Events:

When adding society events you can give it a title; the start time/date; end time/date; a url; and two descriptors from the category list.

Select exactly one topic and one type from the category list on the right.

Click publish to finish adding the event.

4. Add the term card to a page:

To add the term card to a page type the following shortcode on the page: [Term_Card]
